### Profitability

### Returns Analysis
* **Overall Quality:** The overall return rate is low (**~1%**), indicating good product quality control.
* **Risk Area:** Returns for **"High Top"** products doubled in the Mexico region. This signals a potential batch issue or regional dissatisfaction that needs investigation.

3.  **Optimize Operations:** Adjust staffing for weekends based on the 30% transaction volume insight.

## 4. Technical Methodology

* **Logic:** Used DAX Time-Intelligence (`DATESYTD`, `DATEADD`) to calculate growth metrics.
* **Data Integrity:** Verified relationships (1-to-Many) to ensure no double-counting of sales across regions.
